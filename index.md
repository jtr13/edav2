# Welcome!

This is the brand new start of edav.info 2.0!

The [first version of edav.info](https://jtr13.github.io/EDAV/) is still available, but will no longer be updated.

With this resource, we try to give you a curated collection of tools and references that will make it easier to learn how to work with data in R. Detailed Examples will also be used to show proper exploratory data analysis under different circumstances.

This resource is specifically tailored to the GR5293 Statistical Graphics and GR5702 Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization courses offered at Columbia University. However, we hope that anyone interested in working with data in R will benefit from these pages. Happy coding!

(**Note.** edav.info 2.0 is still under construction, and we will try our best to update new chapters weekly so that it will be up-to-date with the information you need to complete the current problem set.)
